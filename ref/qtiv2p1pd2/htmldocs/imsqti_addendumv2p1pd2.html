<p>Caution: this specification is incomplete in its current state.  The IMS QTI project group is in the process of evolving this specification based on input from market participants. Suppliers of products and services are encouraged to participate by contacting Mark McKell at mmckell@imsglobal.org. This specification will be superseded by an updated release based on the input of the project group participants.

<p>Please note that supplier's claims as to implementation of QTI v2.1 and conformance to it HAVE NOT BEEN VALIDATED by IMS GLC. While such suppliers are likely well-intentioned, IMS GLC member organizations have not yet put in place the testing process to validate these claims. IMS GLC currently grants a conformance mark to the Common Cartridge profile of QTI v1.2.1. The authoritative source of products and services that meet this conformance is contained in the IMS online product directory <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/ProductDirectory/directory.cfm">http://www.imsglobal.org/ProductDirectory/directory.cfm</a>

<p>Thank you for your interest in and support of IMS QTI.

<h2>
  <a name="1750741"> </a>§3.2 Simple Items
</h2>
<p>
<a name="1750742"> </a><em>A new example has been added:</em>
<p>
<a name="1750743"> </a><strong>Writing a Postcard with Rubric Information<br></strong><a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/question/qtiv2p1pd2/examples/items/extended_text_rubric.xml">http://www.imsglobal.org/question/qtiv2p1pd2/examples/items/extended_text_rubric.xml</a>
<p>

<h2>
  <a name="1750746"> </a>§3.6 Adaptive Items
</h2>
<p>
<a name="1750747"> </a><em>The following example now has an updated description:</em>
<a name="1751107"> </a><strong>Mexican President with adaptive feedback</strong><br>
<a name="1750749"> </a><a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/question/qtiv2p1pd2/examples/items/feedback_adaptive.xml">http://www.imsglobal.org/question/qtiv2p1pd2/examples/items/feedback_adaptive.xml</a><br>
<p>
<a name="1750750"> </a>In this adaptive example, the candidate receives different feedback for each attempt. The item allows for four incorrect attempts before the correct answer is provided. This example takes advantage of the built-in response variable numAttempts and uses the persistence of outcome values in adaptive items to keep track of the responses given so far (using the variable PREVIOUSRESPONSES) adjusting the inline feedback accordingly.

<p>
<a name="1750767"> </a>This example shows the support for branching based on the response to an assessmentItem. The example uses the <u>preCondition</u> element and the <u>branchRule</u> element.
<p>
<a name="1750768"> </a>The <u>preCondition</u> element sets the conditions that need to be met for an assessmentItem or assessmentSection to be displayed. In nonlinear mode, pre-conditions are ignored.
<p>
<a name="1750769"> </a>The <u>branchRule</u> element contains a rule, evaluated during the test, for setting an alternative target as the next item or section. As with preconditions, branch rules are ignored in nonlinear mode. The second <u>branchRule</u> element contains a special targetItem EXIT_SECTION which means exit this section of the test.

<p>
<a name="1750771"> </a><em>The use of the {ordered} constraint in the definitions was generally inconsistent and has caused some confusion. The {ordered} constraint has now been added to all definitions where the order of multiple attributes or child objects is significant. Although this information is not represented in the resulting XML schema, it may be used by implementers when determining the appropriate data structures to use internally in their applications and should also be used when comparing instances of the declared classes. For example, in the definition of assessmentItem at the beginning of §4 the order of the optional stylesheet and modalFeedback children is significant whereas the order of responseDeclarations (for example) is not. For completeness, the affected definitions are listed in the Appendix.</em>

<h2>
  <a name="1750772"> </a>§5 Item Variables
</h2>

</h2>
<p>
<a name="1750777"> </a><em>The first paragraph of the definition of </em><em>responseDeclaration</em><em> is clarified as follows:</em>

When a weighting is specified the result of the expression always has base-type float. Note that this option is incompatible with baseType integer.

<p>
<a name="1751328"> </a>The index operator takes a sub-expression with an ordered container value and any base-type. The result is the nth value of the container. The result has the same base-type as the sub-expression but single cardinality. The first value of a container has index 1, the second 2 and so on. n must be a positive integer. If n exceeds the number of values in the container (or the sub-expression is NULL) then the result of the index operator is NULL.

<a name="1750810"> </a><em>The definition of the include class was confusing and its representation was incorrect in the schema. The introductory paragraph has been reworded as follows:</em>
<p>
<a name="1750811"> </a>An Item Fragment is part of an item that is managed independently of the items that depend on it. Similarly, a Test Fragment is part of a test that is managed independently of the tests that depend on it. Fragments are packaged as separate resources and can be transported independently. A fragment may appear anywhere in the model where one of the following abstract classes may appear: <u>flowStatic</u>, <u>inlineStatic</u>, <u>blockStatic</u>, <u>responseRule</u>, <u>sectionPart</u> or <u>outcomeRule</u>. For example, an item fragment may be a division of the <u>itemBody</u> represented by an instance of the <u>div</u> class or a single <u>interaction</u>.
<p>
<a name="1751824"> </a><em>The class definition has been updated to show the correct list of classes from which it inherits:</em>

<h2>
  <a name="1751826"> </a>§17 Basic Data Types
</h2>
<p>
<a name="1750815"> </a><em>The definition of the identifier type has been updated to reflect the new use of the period character as a prefix delimitter. This change replaces the reference to "future ues" and re-enforces the fact that the period must not be used except when used as a prefix delimiter:</em>
<p>
<a name="1750816"> </a><strong>Datatype: identifier</strong>
<p>
<a name="1750817"> </a>An identifier is simply a logical reference to another object in the item, such as an itemVariable or choice. An identifier is a string of characters that must start with a Letter or an underscore ('_') and contain only Letters, underscores, hyphens ('-'), period ('.', a.k.a. full-stop), Digits, CombiningChars and Extenders. Identifiers containing the period character are reserved for use in prefixing, as described in the definition of variable. The character classes Letter, Digit, CombiningChar and Extender are defined in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Second Edition) [XML]. Note particularly that identifiers may not contain the colon (':') character. Identifiers should have no more than 32 characters for compatibility with version 1. They are always compared case-sensitively.

<a name="1750824"> </a><em>The usage of correctResponse in responseVariable has been clarified as follows:</em>

<a name="1750825"> </a><strong>Contains</strong> : correctResponse [0..1]
<p>
<a name="1750826"> </a>The correct response may be output as part of the report if desired. Systems are not limited to reporting correct responses declared in responseDeclarations. For example, a correct response may be set by a templateRule or may simply have been suppressed from the declaration passed to the delivery engine (e.g., for security).
<p>
<a name="1750827"> </a><em>As well as adding the {ordered} constraint the definition of candidateResponse.value has been updated as follows:</em>

<p>
<a name="1750829"> </a>The value(s) of the response variable. A NULL value, resulting from no response, is indicated by the absence of any value. The order of the values is significant only if the response was declared with ordered cardinality.
