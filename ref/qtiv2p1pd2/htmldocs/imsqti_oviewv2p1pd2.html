<h2><a name="section10001">1. Question and Test Interoperability</a></h2>



<p><a name="section10001">The IMS Question &amp; Test Interoperability (QTI) specification describes a data
                model for the representation of question (assessmentItem) and test (assessmentTest)
                data and their corresponding results reports. Therefore, the specification enables
                the exchange of this item, test, and results data between authoring tools, item
                banks, test constructional tools, learning systems, and assessment delivery systems.
                The data model is described abstractly, using </a><a href="#ref_UML">[UML]</a> to facilitate
                binding to a wide range of data-modeling tools and programming languages, however,
                for interchange <em>between</em> systems a binding is provided to the industry
                standard eXtensible Markup Language <a href="#ref_XML">[XML]</a> and use of this binding is
                strongly recommended. The IMS QTI specification has been designed to support both
                interoperability and innovation through the provision of well-defined extension
                points. These extension points can be used to wrap specialized or proprietary data
                in ways that allows it to be used alongside items that can be represented directly.</p>



<h3><a name="section10002">1.1. History of this Specification</a></h3>



<p><a name="section10002">An initial V0.5 specification was released for discussion in March 1999 and in
                    November it was agreed to develop IMS Question &amp; Test Interoperability
                    v1.0 which was released as a public draft in February 2000 and as a final
                    specification in May that year. The specification was extended and updated
                    twice, in March 2001 and January 2002. By February of that year in excess of
                    6000 copies of the IMS QTI <em>1.x</em> specifications had been downloaded from
                    the IMS website.</a></p>



<p><a name="section10002">Since then, a number of issues of have been raised by implementers and reviewed
                    by the QTI project team. Many of them were dealt with in an addendum, which
                    defined version 1.2.1 of the specification and was released in March 2003. Some
                    of the issues could not be dealt with this way as they required changes to the
                    specification that would not be backwardly compatible or because they uncovered
                    more fundamental issues that would require extensive clarification or
                    significant extension of the specification to resolve.</a></p>



<p><a name="section10002">Since the QTI specification was first conceived, the breadth of IMS
                    specifications has grown and work on Content Packaging, Simple Sequencing, and
                    most recently Learning Design created the need for a cross-specification review.
                    This review took place during 2003 and a number of harmonization issues
                    affecting QTI were identified. In September that year a project charter was
                    agreed to address both the collected issues from <em>1.x</em> and the
                    harmonization issues and to draft QTI V2.0. In order to make the work manageable
                    and ensure that results were returned to the community at the earliest
                    opportunity some restrictions were placed on the scope of the recommended work.
                    Therefore, the QTI V2.0 release of the specification concentrated only on the
                    individual assessmentItem and did not update those parts of the specification
                    that dealt with the aggregation of items into sections and tests or the
                    reporting of results. This QTI <em>2.1</em> release completes the update from
                        <em>1.x</em> to <em>2.x</em> by replacing those remaining parts of the QTI
                    specification. </a></p>



<h3><a name="section10003">1.2. Scope</a></h3>



<p><a name="section10003">The IMS QTI work specifically relates to content providers (that is, question and
                    test authors and publishers), developers of authoring and content management
                    tools, assessment delivery systems, and learning systems. The data model for
                    representing question-based content is suitable for targeting users in learning,
                    education, and training across all age ranges and national contexts.</a></p>




<h2><a name="section10004">2. Specification Use Cases</a></h2>



<p><a name="section10004">QTI is designed to facilitate interoperability between a number of systems that are
                described here in relation to the actors that use them.</a></p>



<p><a name="section10004">Specifically, QTI is designed to:</a></p>



<ul>




  <a name="section10004">				<li>Provide a well documented content format for storing and exchanging
                    <em>items</em> independent of the authoring tool used to create them.</li>




				<li>Support the deployment of item banks across a wide range of learning and
                    assessment delivery systems.</li>




				<li>Provide a well documented content format for storing and exchanging
                    <em>tests</em> independent of the test construction tool used to create them.</li>




				<li>Support the deployment of items, item banks, and tests from diverse sources in a
                    single learning or assessment delivery system.</li>




				<li>Provide systems with the ability to report test results in a consistent
                manner.</li>

<p><a name="element10000"><b><code>authoringTool</code></b></a></p>



<p><a name="element10000">A system used by an author for creating or modifying an
                assessment item.</a></p>



<p><a name="element10001"><b><code>itemBank</code></b></a></p>

                assessment items. </a></p>



<p><a name="element10002"><b><code>testConstructionTool</code></b></a></p>



<p><a name="element10002">A system for assembling tests from individual
                items.</a></p>



<p><a name="element10003"><b><code>assessmentDeliverySystem</code></b></a></p>



<p><a name="element10003">A system for managing the delivery of
                assessments to candidates. The system contains a delivery engine for delivering the
                items to the candidates and scores the responses automatically (where applicable) or
                by distributing them to </a><a href="#element10009">scorer</a>s.</p>



<p><a name="element10004"><b><code>learningSystem</code></b></a></p>



<p><a name="element10004">A system that enables or directs learners in learning
                activities, possibly coordinated with a </a><a href="#element10010">tutor</a>. For the
                purposes of this specification a learner exposed to an assessment item as part of an
                interaction with a learning system (i.e., through formative assessment) is still
                described as a <a href="#element10011">candidate</a> as no formal distinction between
                formative and summative assessment is made. A learning system is also considered to
                contain a delivery engine though the administration and security model is likely to
                be very different from that employed by an <a href="#element10003">assessmentDeliverySystem</a>.</p>



<h3><a name="section10005">2.1. Use Case Actors</a></h3>



<p><a name="section10005">The set of roles identified in this specification have been reduced to a small
                    set of abstract actors for simplicity. Typically, roles in real learning and
                    assessment systems are more complex but, for the purposes of this specification,
                    it is assumed that they can be generalized by one or more of the roles defined
                    here.</a></p>



<p><a name="element10005"><b><code>author</code></b></a></p>



<p><a name="element10005">The author of an assessment item. In simple situations an item
                    may have a single author, in more complex situations an item may go through a
                    creation and quality control process involving many people. In this
                    specification we identify all of these people with the role of author. An author
                    is concerned with the content of an item, which distinguishes them from the role
                    of an </a><a href="#element10006">itemBankManager</a>. An author interacts with an item
                    through an <a href="#element10000">authoringTool</a>.</p>



<p><a name="element10006"><b><code>itemBankManager</code></b></a></p>



<p><a name="element10006">An actor with responsibility for managing a collection
                    of assessment items with an </a><a href="#element10001">itemBank</a>.</p>



<p><a name="element10007"><b><code>testConstructor</code></b></a></p>



<p><a name="element10007">The role of test constructor is to create tests (test
                    forms) from individual items. The items are typically drawn from an item bank.</a></p>



<p><a name="element10008"><b><code>proctor</code></b></a></p>



<p><a name="element10008">A person charged with overseeing the delivery of an
                    assessment. Often referred to as an invigilator. For the purposes of this
                    specification a proctor is anyone (other than the candidate) who is involved in
                    the delivery process but who does not have a role in assessing the candidate's
                    responses.</a></p>



<p><a name="element10009"><b><code>scorer</code></b></a></p>



<p><a name="element10009">A person or external system responsible for assessing the
                    candidate's responses during assessment delivery. Scorers are optional, for
                    example, many assessment items can be scored automatically using response
                    processing rules defined in the item itself.</a></p>



<p><a name="element10010"><b><code>tutor</code></b></a></p>



<p><a name="element10010">Someone involved in managing, directing, or supporting the
                    learning process for a learner but who is not subject to (the same) assessment.</a></p>



<p><a name="element10011"><b><code>candidate</code></b></a></p>



<p><a name="element10011">The person being assessed by an assessment test or
                    assessment item.</a></p>
