<p>Caution: this specification is incomplete in its current state.  The IMS QTI project group is in the process of evolving this specification based on input from market participants. Suppliers of products and services are encouraged to participate by contacting Mark McKell at mmckell@imsglobal.org. This specification will be superseded by an updated release based on the input of the project group participants.

<p>Please note that supplier's claims as to implementation of QTI v2.1 and conformance to it HAVE NOT BEEN VALIDATED by IMS GLC. While such suppliers are likely well-intentioned, IMS GLC member organizations have not yet put in place the testing process to validate these claims. IMS GLC currently grants a conformance mark to the Common Cartridge profile of QTI v1.2.1. The authoritative source of products and services that meet this conformance is contained in the IMS online product directory <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/ProductDirectory/directory.cfm">http://www.imsglobal.org/ProductDirectory/directory.cfm</a>

<h2><a name="section10003">3. Items</a></h2>


<p><a name="section10003">The main purpose of the QTI specification is to define an information model and
                associated binding that can be used to represent and exchange assessment items. For
                the purposes of QTI, an item is a set of interactions (possibly empty) collected
                together with any supporting material and an optional set of rules for converting
                the candidate's response(s) into assessment <em>outcomes</em>.</a></p>


<h3><a name="section10004">3.1. How Big is an Item?</a></h3>


<p><a name="section10004">The above definition covers a wide array of possibilities. At one extreme a
                    simple one line question with a response box for entering an answer is clearly
                    an item but at the other, an entire test comprising instructions, stimulus
                    material and a large number of associated questions also satisfies the
                    definition. In the first case, QTI is an appropriate specification to use for
                    representing the information, in the second case it isn't.</a></p>


<p><a name="section10004">To help determine whether or not a piece of assessment content that comprises
                    multiple interactions should be represented as a single </a><a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10012">assessmentItem</a> (known as a composite item in QTI) the strength of
                    the relationship between the interactions should be examined. If they can stand
                    alone then they may best be implemented as separate items, perhaps sharing a
                    piece of stimulus material like a picture or a passage of text included as an
                        <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10173">object</a>. If several interactions <em>are</em> closely
                    related then they may belong in a composite item, but always consider the
                    question of how easy it is for the candidate to keep track of the state of the
                    item when it contains multiple related interactions. If the question requires
                    the user to scroll a window on their computer screen just to see all the
                    interactions then the item may be better re-written as several smaller related
                    items. Consider also the difficulty faced by a user interacting with the item
                    through a screen-reader, an item with many possible of points of interaction may
                    be overwhelming in such an interface.</p>


<h3><a name="section10005">3.2. Simple Items</a></h3>


<p><a name="section10005">Simple items are items that contain just one point of interaction, for example a
                    simple multi-choice or multi-response question. This section describes a set of
                    examples illustrating simple items, one for each of the interaction types
                    supported by the specification.</a></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;" align="center">Figure 3.1 Unattended Luggage (Illustration).</p>



					
<p>This example illustrates the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10278">choiceInteraction</a> being
                        used to obtain a single response from the candidate.</p>



					
<p>Notice that the candidate's response is declared at the top of the item to be
                        a single identifier and that the values this identifier can take are the
                        values of the corresponding <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10272">identifier</a>
                        attributes on the individual <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10289">simpleChoice</a>s. The
                        correct answer is included in the <em>declaration</em> of the response. In
                        simple examples like this one there is just one response variable and one
                        interaction but notice that the interaction must still be bound to the
                        response declaration using the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10265">responseIdentifier</a> attribute of <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10278">choiceInteraction</a>.</p>



					
<p>The item is scored using one of the standard response processing templates,
                            <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#auxFile.matchCorrect">Match Correct</a>.</p>

<p>This example is a variation on the previous example and illustrates the

<p>This example is identical to <a href="#auxFile.choiceExample">Unattended Luggage</a> except that
                        it illustrates the use of the DTD binding instead of the XSD. The XSD form
                        is preferred and the alternative binding method using the DTD is illustrated
                        for this example only.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;" align="center">Figure 3.2 Composition of Water (Illustration).</p>



					
<p>This example illustrates the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10278">choiceInteraction</a> being
                        used to obtain multiple responses from the candidate.</p>



					
<p>Notice that the candidate's response is declared to have <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10050">multiple</a> cardinality and the correct value is
                        therefore composed of more than one <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10042">value</a>. This
                        example could have been scored in the same way as the previous one, with 1
                        mark being given for correctly identifying the two correct elements (and
                        only the two correct elements) and 0 marks given otherwise; however, a
                        method that gives partial credit has been adopted instead through the use of
                        the standard response processing template <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#auxFile.mapResponse">Map Response</a>.
                        This template uses the <em>RESPONSE</em>'s <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10065">mapping</a> to
                        sum the values assigned to the individual choices. As a result, identifying
                        the correct two choices (only) scores 2 points. Notice that selecting a
                        third (incorrect) choice <em>reduces</em> the score by 2 (with the exception
                        of Chlorine) resulting in 0 as unmapped keys are mapped to the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10068">defaultValue</a>. To prevent an overall negative score
                        bounds are specified too. The penalty for selecting Chlorine is less,
                        perhaps to reflect its role as a common water additive.</p>



					
<p>Also note that <em>SCORE</em> needs to be set to float because of the use of the map_response template which returns a float.</p>

<p>This example illustrates the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10283">orderInteraction</a>. The
                        candidate's response is declared to have <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10051">ordered</a> and the correct value is therefore composed
                        of an ordered list of <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10042">value</a>. The <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10285">shuffle</a> attribute tells the delivery engine to
                        shuffle the order of the choices before displaying them to the candidate.
                        Note that the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10273">fixed</a> attribute is used to ensure
                        that the initially presented order is never the correct answer. The question
                        uses the standard response processing template <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#auxFile.matchCorrect">Match Correct</a> to score 1 for a completely correct answer and 0

                        because the task involves pairing up the choices. The <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10293">maxAssociations</a> attribute on <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10291">associateInteraction</a> controls the maximum number of pairings
                        the candidate is allowed to make overall. Individually, each choice has a
                            <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10302">matchMax</a> attribute that
                        controls how many pairings it can be part of. The number of associations
                        that can be made in an <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10291">associateInteraction</a> is
                        therefore constrained by two methods&mdash;in this case they have the same
                        overall effect but this needn't be the case.</p>



					
<p>The associations created by the candidate are not directed, the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10060">pair</a> base-type is an <em>undirected</em> pair so when
                        comparing responses "A P" would be treated as a match for "P A"&mdash;the
                        distinction has no meaning to the interaction even though the physical
                        process used by the candidate might be directional, for example, drawing a
                        line between the choices.</p>

<p>This example illustrates the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10296">matchInteraction</a>. This
                        time the candidate's response is declared to have <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10061">directedPair</a> because the task involves pairing up
                        choices from a source set into a target set. In this case characters from
                        plays with the names of the plays from which they are drawn. Notice that
                            <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10302">matchMax</a> on the characters
                        is one because each character can be in only one play (in fact, Shakespeare
                        often reused character names but we digress) but it is four on the plays
                        because each play could contain all the characters. For example, Demetrius
                        and Lysander were both in <em>A Midsummer-Night's Dream</em>, so in the
                        correct response that play has two associations. In the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10065">mapping</a> used for response processing these two associations
                        have been awarded only a half a mark each.</p>

<p>The <a href="#auxFile.gapMatch">Richard III (Take 1)</a> example above demonstrated the use of
                        filling gaps from a shared stock of choices. In cases where you only have
                        one gap, or where you have multiple gaps that are to be filled
                        independently, each from its own list of choices, then you use an

<p style="font-weight: bold;" align="center">Figure 3.8 Richard III (Illustration 3).</p>



					
<p>The third, and final method of filling gaps is to use an <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10332">textEntryInteraction</a> which requires the candidate to construct
                        their own response, typically by typing it in. Notice that a guide to the
                        amount of text to be entered is given in the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10329">expectedLength</a> attribute&mdash;though candidates

<p>The scoring for this item could have just matched the correct response but
                        actually uses a mapping to enable partial credit for <em>york</em> (spelled
                        without a capital letter). When mapping strings the mapping always takes
                        place case sensitively. This example also illustrates the use of the mapping
                        when the response only has <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10049">single</a>

<p>Response processing consists of a sequence of rules that are carried out, in

                        rule is a special type of rule which contains sub-sequences of rules divided

                        and <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10418">responseElse</a> sections. The response processor
                        evaluates the expressions in the responseIf and responseElseIf elements to
                        determine which sub-sequence to follow. In this example, the responseIf

                        matches the correct response declared for it. The responseElseIf section is
                        followed if <em>RESPONSE</em> matches the response explicitly given (which
                        places the correct driver 1st but confuses the other two). Finally, the
                        responseElse section is followed if neither of the previous two apply. The
                        responseElse section has no corresponding expression of course. The

<h3><a name="section10009">3.6. Adaptive Items</a></h3>


<p><a name="section10009">Adaptive items are a new feature of version 2 that allows an item to be scored
                    adaptively over a sequence of attempts. This allows the candidate to alter their
                    answer following feedback or to be posed additional questions based on their
                    current answer. Response processing works differently for adaptive items.
                    Normally (for non-adaptive items) each attempt is independent and the outcome
                    variables are set to their default values each time </a><a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10403">responseProcessing</a> is carried out. For adaptive items, the outcome
                    variables retain their values across multiple attempts and are only updated by
                    subsequent response processing. This difference is indicated by the value of the
                        <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10017">adaptive</a> attribute of the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10012">assessmentItem</a>. Adaptive items must of course provide feedback to

<p>This example takes a famous mathematical problem and presents it to the user
                        as a game. The <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10250">feedbackBlock</a> element, in association
                        with a number of outcome variables is used to control the flow of the story,
                        from the opening gambit through to whether or not you have won a prize. When
                        the story concludes you are asked about the strategy you adopted. Notice
                        that the scoring for the question is based on the actual strategy you took
                        (one mark) and your answer to the final question (two marks). If you choose
                        a bad strategy initially you are always punished by losing the game. If you
                        feel that this is cheating take a look at a more realistic version of the
                        same question which combines adaptivity with the powerful feature of item
                        templates: <a href="#auxFile.adaptiveTemplate">Monty Hall (Take 2)</a>.</p>

<p>In the previous example, the default method of ending an attempt was used to
                    progress through the item, however, sometimes it is desirable to provide
                    alternative ways for the candidate to end an attempt. The most common
                    requirement is the option of requesting a hint instead of submitting a final
                    answer. QTI provides a flexible way to accommodate these alternative paths
                    through the special purpose <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10401">endAttemptInteraction</a>. </p>

<p>In this example, <a href="#auxFile.feedback">Mexican President</a> is extended to provide both

                        variable <em>HINTREQUEST</em> - which is true if the attempt ended with a
                        request for a hint and false otherwise.</p>

<p>This example contains a simple <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10332">textEntryInteraction</a> but
                        the question (and the correct answer) varies for each item session. In
                        addition to the usual <em>RESPONSE</em> and <em>SCORE</em> variables a
                        number of template variables are declared. Their values are set by a set of
                            <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10447">templateProcessing</a> rules. Template processing is
                        very similar to response processing. The same condition model and expression
                        language are used. The difference is that <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10449">templateRule</a>s set the values of template variables and not outcome variables. Notice
                        that the declaration of <em>RESPONSE</em> does not declare a value for the
                            <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10077">correctResponse</a> because the answer varies
                        depending on which values are chosen for <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>. Instead,
                        a special rule is used, <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10465">setCorrectResponse</a> in the
                        template processing section.</p>



					
<p>The <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10583">randomInteger</a> element represents a simple
                        expression that selects a random integer from a specified range. The
                            <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10623">random</a> element represents an operator that selects
                        a random value from a container.</p>



					
<p>The <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10110">itemBody</a> displays the values of the template
                        variables using the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10254">printedVariable</a> element.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is desirable to vary some aspect of an item that cannot be
                        represented directly by the value of a template variable. For example, in
                        "Mick's Travels", the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10110">itemBody</a> contains an
                        illustration that needs to be varied according to the value chosen for a
                        template variable. To achieve this three <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10442">templateInline</a> elements are used, each one enclosing a different <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10233">img</a> element. This element (along with the similar <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10440">templateBlock</a>) has attributes for controlling its visibility
                        with template variables in the same way as outcome variables are used to
                        control the visibility of feedback.</p>



				
<p>Item templates can be combined with adaptive items too.</p>

<p>In <a href="#auxFile.adaptive">Monty Hall (Take 1)</a> we cheated by fixing the game so that the
                        wrong strategy always lost the candidate the prize (and the first mark). In
                        this version we present a more realistic version of the game using an item
                        template. The same outcome variables are defined to control the story and
                        the feedback given but this time a <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10433">templateDeclaration</a>
                        is used to declare the variable <em>PRIZEDOOR</em>. The <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10447">templateProcessing</a> rules are then used to preselect the winning
                        door at random making the game more realistic. The <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10403">responseProcessing</a> rules are a little more complicated as the
                        value of <em>PRIZEDOOR</em> must be checked (a) to ensure that Monty doesn't
                        open the prize winning door after the candidate's first choice and (b) to
                        see if the candidate has actually won the "fantastic prize".</p>



					
<p> In this example, using the correct strategy will still lose the candidate
                        the prize 1/3 of the time (though they always get the mark). Do you think
                        that the outcome of the game will effect the response to the final strategy
                        question?</p>

<p>This example illustrates a test consisting of a set of three items
                    (rtest01-set01.xml, rtest01-set02.xml, rtest01-set02.xml) sharing a single
                    fragment of leading material (rtest01-fragment.xml). The fragment is included in
                    each of the assessmentItems in the set by using the XInclude mechanism.</p>



				
<p>The submission mode is set to individual mode requiring the candidate to submit
                    their responses on an item-by-item basis. </p>



				
<p>The navigation mode is set to linear mode restricting the candidate to attempt
                    each item in turn. Once the candidate moves on they are not permitted to
                return.</p>



			
<p><a name="auxFile.RTEST_02"><b>Arbitrary Collections of Item Outcomes</b><br>


<code></code></a><a href="examples/tests/rtest02.xml">examples/tests/rtest02.xml</a></p>



				
<p>This example illustrates the use of two assessmentSections (sectionA and
                    sectionB) and one subsection (sectionB1). Both sectionA and sectionB are
                    visible, meaning that they are identifiable by the candidate. Conversely,
                    sectionB1 is not identifiable as a section. </p>



				
<p>The submission mode is set to simultaneous. The candidate's responses are all
                    submitted together at the end of the testPart (in this case effectively meaning
                    at the end of the assessmentTest). </p>



				
<p>The navigation mode is set to nonlinear mode allowing the candidate to navigate
                    to any item in the test at any time.</p>



				
<p>The test uses <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10525">weight</a>s to determine the contribution of the
                    individual item score to the overall test score. In this example the weight of
                    0 for item160 means that its score isn't taken into account when calculating the
                    overall test score. The weight of 2 for item034 means that the score for item034
                    is multiplied by 2 when calculating the overall test score.</p>



				
<p>For the assessmentItems where no weight is given, a weight of 1.0 is assumed.</p>



			
<p><a name="auxFile.RTEST_03"><b>Categories of Item</b><br>


<code></code></a><a href="examples/tests/rtest03.xml">examples/tests/rtest03.xml</a></p>



				
<p>This example illustrates the use of categories of assessmentItems in the
                    assessmentTest.</p>



				
<p>The submission mode is set to simultaneous. The candidate's responses are all
                    submitted together at the end of the testPart (in this case effectively meaning
                    at the end of the assessmentTest). </p>



				
<p>The navigation mode is set to nonlinear mode allowing the candidate to navigate
                    to any item in the test at any time.</p>



				
<p>The test uses the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10521">category</a> assign the
                    items to one or more categories. The outcomeprocessing part of the example shows
                    how the category is being used to sum the score of a selection of the
                questions.</p>

<p>This example illustrates the use of itemSessionControl to set the number of
                    allowed attempts.</p>



				
<p>The example contains two <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10488">testPart</a>s, the maximum number of
                    allowed attempts for the first testPart is set to unlimited (maxAttempts = 0)
                    and the maximum number of allowed attempts for the second testPart is 1.</p>



				
<p>The submission mode for both <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10488">testPart</a>s is set to individual
                    mode requiring the candidate to submit their responses on an item-by-item basis. </p>



				
<p>The navigation mode for both testParts is set to linear mode restricting the
                    candidate to attempt each item in turn. Once the candidate moves on they are not
                    permitted to return.</p>

<code></code></a><a href="examples/tests/rtest08.xml">examples/tests/rtest08.xml</a></p>



				
<p>This example illustrates the use of itemSessionControl to set the item feedback
                    in relation to the test.</p>



				
<p>The submission mode for the second testPart is set to simultaneous. The
                    candidate's responses are all submitted together at the end of the testPart. </p>



				
<p>The navigation mode of the second testPart is set to nonlinear mode allowing the
                    candidate to navigate to any item in the testPart at any time.</p>



				
<p>The <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10031">showFeedback</a> attribute of
                        <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10029">itemSessionControl</a> is set to true, affecting the
                    visibility of feedback after the end of the last attempt.</p>



				
<p>Allowing review and feedback in simultaneous mode means that the test is
                    navigable after submission (in this case, in a nonlinear style)</p>



				
<p>The <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10033">showSolution</a> attribute of
                        <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10029">itemSessionControl</a> is set to false, meaning the system
                    may not provide the candidate with a way of entering the solution state.</p>



				
<p>Remember that the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10031">showFeedback</a> attribute
                    controls the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10012">assessmentItem</a> feedback on test level. It
                    doesn't overrule the display of feedback as set inside the item.</p>



			
<p><a name="auxFile.RTEST_09"><b>Steve's Test</b><br>


<code></code></a><a href="examples/tests/rtest09.xml">examples/tests/rtest09.xml</a></p>



				
<p>This example illustrates controlling the duration of an item attempt (both
                    maximum and minimum) in the context of a specific test.</p>



				
<p>The test shows the use of the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10534">timeLimits</a> element to set the
                        <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10536">maxTime</a> constraint for the complete test, a
                    single assessmentSection and a single assessmentItem.</p>



				
<p>The example contains one <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10519">assessmentItemRef</a> (item034) which
                    has a <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10535">minTime</a> of 3 minutes and a <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10536">maxTime</a> of 10 minutes. This means that candidates cannot
                    progress to the next item in the test (item160) until they have spent 3 minutes
                    interacting with it. Given that the candidate is limited to a maximum of 1
                    attempt at each item in the test, this effectively means that the candidate is
                    prevented from submitting their responses until 3 minutes have passed. However,
                    they <em>must</em> submit their responses before 10 minutes have passed. When
                    the time limit is up the current responses would typically be submitted
                    automatically.</p>



				
<p>It is up to the assessment constructor to make sure that the sum of all
                        <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10536">maxTime</a> elements in the assessment is
                    smaller or equal to the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10536">maxTime</a> of the
                    assessmentTest and that the sum of all <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10535">minTime</a>

                    the required="true" attribute) so we effectively select B1 and one of the other
                    three items. B1 is an invisible section and the three items it contains will be

                    and other objects within the usage-data file itself are not considered to be
                    dependencies of the resource. The resource type for usage-data files is

                    demonstrates the use of a resource element to associate meta-data (both LOM and
                    QTI) with an item and the file element to reference the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10012">assessmentItem</a> XML file and the associated image file.</p>

<p>This example demonstrates how multiple items are packaged. Note that where two
                    items share a media object (such as an image) a dependency can be used to enable
                    the object to be represented by its own resource element within the
                manifest.</p>

<code></code></a><a href="examples/package_maxfiles/imsmanifest.xml">examples/package_maxfiles/imsmanifest.xml</a></p>



				
<p>The response processing templates feature of QTI allows common sets of response
                    processing rules to be documented in separate XML documents and simply referred
                    to by the items that make use of them. The mechanism for identifying the
                    template to use is the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10404">template</a>
                    attribute on the <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10403">responseProcessing</a> element. This
                    attribute is a URI, but it is not required to be a URL that resolves directly to
                    the appropriate XML document. To help systems that support general response
                    processing find the rule definitions required to support new templates an
                    additional <a href="imsqti_infov2p1pd2.html#element10405">templateLocation</a> attribute
                    is provided which <em>may</em> be used to provide a URL that resolves to the
                    template's XML document. If this URL is given relative to the location of the
                    item then the template should be included in the same content package and listed
                    as a dependency for each of the items that refer to it.</p>



				
<p>This example package demonstrates the use of a relative URL to refer to response
                    processing templates listed as separate resources within the package as
                    described above. Note that the technique used is similar to that for locating
                    XML schemas from the URIs used to refer to their namespaces, however, XML
                    schemas included in content packages to assist with validation should
                    <em>not</em> be described as separate resources (or file dependencies) in the
                    manifest file.</p>

                    Both the assesmentTest and assessmentItems are represented by resource elements

<h2><a name="section10021">7. Validation</a></h2>


<p><a name="section10021">The QTI schema file imports two externally defined auxiliary schemas, the built-in
                XML namespace and MathML. The schema imports these from their published locations on
                the web using absolute URLs. As a result, some XML validation tools may not be able
                to validate QTI documents when working offline.</a></p>


<p><a name="section10021">There is also some confusion as to whether or not XML schemas that refer to
                components of the built-in XML namespace (such as the xml:lang attribute used by
                QTI) should (or even <em>may</em>) provide an associated namespace prefix
                declaration. This point was unclear in the first edition of the XML specification
                and not cleared up until the errata to that addition </a><a href="#ref_XML_ERRATA">[XML_ERRATA]</a> was
                published. The errata has itself now been superseded by the second edition <a href="#ref_XML">[XML]</a> which makes it clear that the declaration <em>may</em> be included
                provided it is bound to the reserved prefix <em>xml</em> but that it is <em>not</em>
                required. In keeping with the latest IMS Content Packaging specification the QTI
                schema includes the declaration in the root of the <em>schema</em>. It is clear that
                some tools will still not validate documents against schemas that contain this
                prefix and a local copy of the QTI schema with the following attribute removed from
                the schema element may need to be used instead:</p>


<pre> xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace"</pre>


<p>The namespace identifier of the QTI schema has changed for version 2.1 of
                this specification to <code>http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/imsqti_v2p1</code>. Use of
                this namespace is required when using any of the new elements defined by this
                version. Documents with a namespace of
                    <code>http://www.imsglobal.org/xsd/imsqti_v2p0</code> must still be supported.
                For compatibility systems may wish to use the 2p0 namespace identifier when
                generating content that conforms to the narrower model defined by version 2.0 of
                this specification.</p>
