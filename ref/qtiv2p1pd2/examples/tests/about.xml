	<auxfile name="RTEST-01" title="Sets of Items With Leading Material"
		url="examples/tests/rtest01.xml">
		<p>This example illustrates a test consisting of a set of three items (rtest01-set01.xml,
			rtest01-set02.xml, rtest01-set02.xml) sharing a single fragment of leading material
			(rtest01-fragment.xml). The fragment is included in each of the assessmentItems in the
			set by using the XInclude mechanism.</p>
		<p>The submission mode is set to individual mode requiring the candidate to submit their
			responses on an item-by-item basis. </p>
		<p>The navigation mode is set to linear mode restricting the candidate to attempt each item
			in turn. Once the candidate moves on they are not permitted to return.</p>
	</auxfile>
	<auxfile name="RTEST-02" title="Arbitrary Collections of Item Outcomes"
		url="examples/tests/rtest02.xml">
		<p>This example illustrates the use of two assessmentSections (sectionA and sectionB) and
			one subsection (sectionB1). Both sectionA and sectionB are visible, meaning that they
			are identifiable by the candidate. Conversely, sectionB1 is not identifiable as a
			section. </p>
		<p>The submission mode is set to simultaneous. The candidate's responses are all submitted
			together at the end of the testPart (in this case effectively meaning at the end of the
			assessmentTest). </p>
		<p>The navigation mode is set to nonlinear mode allowing the candidate to navigate to any
			item in the test at any time.</p>
		<p>The test uses <element_ref name="weight"/>s to determine the contribution of the
			inidividual item score to the overall test score. In this example the weight of 0 for
			item160 means that its score isn't taken into account when calculating the overall test
			score. The weight of 2 for item034 means that the score for item034 is multiplied by 2
			when calculating the overall test score.</p>
		<p>For the assessmentItems where no weight is given, a weight of 1.0 is assumed.</p>

	<auxfile name="RTEST-03" title="Categories of Item" url="examples/tests/rtest03.xml">
		<p>This example illustrates the use of categories of assessmentItems in the assessmentTest.</p>
		<p>The submission mode is set to simultaneous. The candidate's responses are all submitted
			together at the end of the testPart (in this case effectively meaning at the end of the
			assessmentTest). </p>
		<p>The navigation mode is set to nonlinear mode allowing the candidate to navigate to any
			item in the test at any time.</p>
		<p>The test uses the <element_ref name="category"/> assign the items to one or more
			categories. The outcomeprocessing part of the example shows how the category is being
			used to sum the score of a selection of the questions.</p>

	<auxfile name="RTEST-06" title="Specifiying the Number of Allowed Attempts"
		url="examples/tests/rtest06.xml">
		<p>This example illustrates the use of itemSessionControl to set the number of allowed
			attempts.</p>
		<p>The example contains two <element_ref name="testPart"/>s, the maximum number of allowed
			attempts for the first testPart is set to unlimited (maxAttempts = 0) and the maximum
			number of allowed attempts for the second testPart is 1.</p>
		<p>The submission mode for both <element_ref name="testPart"/>s is set to individual mode
			requiring the candidate to submit their responses on an item-by-item basis. </p>
		<p>The navigation mode for both testParts is set to linear mode restricting the candidate to
			attempt each item in turn. Once the candidate moves on they are not permitted to
		return.</p>

	<auxfile name="RTEST-08" title="Controlling Item Feedback in Relation to the Test"
		url="examples/tests/rtest08.xml">
		<p>This example illustrates the use of itemSessionControl to set the item feedback in
			relation to the test.</p>
		<p>The submission mode for the second testPart is set to simultaneous. The candidate's
			responses are all submitted together at the end of the testPart. </p>
		<p>The navigation mode of the second testPart is set to nonlinear mode allowing the
			candidate to navigate to any item in the testPart at any time.</p>
		<p>The <element_ref name="showFeedback"/> attribute of <element_ref
				name="itemSessionControl"/> is set to true, affecting the visibility of feedback
			after the end of the last attempt.</p>
		<p>Allowing review and feedback in simultaneous mode means that the test is navigable after
			submission (in this case, in a nonlinear style)</p>
		<p>The <element_ref name="showSolution"/> attribute of <element_ref
				name="itemSessionControl"/> is set to false, meaning the system maynot provide the
			candidate with a way of entering the solution state.</p>
		<p>Remember that the <element_ref name="showFeedback"/> attribute controls the <element_ref
				name="assessmentItem"/> feedback on test level. It doesn't overrule the display of
			feedback as set inside the item.</p>
	</auxfile>
	<auxfile name="RTEST-09" title="Steve's Test" url="examples/tests/rtest09.xml">
		<p>This example illustrates controlling the duration of an item attempt (both maximum and
			minimum) in the context of a specific test.</p>
		<p>The test shows the use of the <element_ref name="timeLimits"/> element to set the
				<element_ref name="maxSessionTime"/> and <element_ref name="maxRealTime"/>
			constraints for the complete test, a single assessmentSection and a single
			assessmentItem.</p>
		<p>The example contains one <element_ref name="assessmentItemRef"/> (item034) which has a
				<element_ref name="minSessionTime"/> of 3 minutes and a <element_ref
				name="maxSessionTime"/> of 10 minutes. This means that ...... (WHAT DOES THIS
			MEAN????).</p>
		<p>It is up to the assessment constructor to make sure that the sum of all <element_ref
				name="maxSessionTime"/> elements in the assessment is smaller or equal to the
				<element_ref name="maxSessionTime"/> of the assessmentTest and that the sum of all
				<element_ref name="minSessionTime"/> elements in the assessment is smaller or equal
			to the <element_ref name="maxSessionTime"/> of the assessmentTest. </p>

		<p>This example shows how to provide support for early termination of test based on
			accumulated item outcomes.</p>
		<p>The <element_ref name="outcomeProcessing"/> for the test is invoked after each attempt
			and checkes to see if the SCORE is greater than 3. If that is the case the <element_ref
				name="exitTest"/> terminates the test.</p>

		url="examples/tests/rtest12.xml">
		<p> In assessmentSection B, we select 2 children using the <element_ref name="selection"/>
			element, but assessmentSection B1 is required (because of the required="true" attribute)
			so we effectively select B1 and one of the other three items. B1 is an invisible section
			and the three items it contains will be mixed in with the other selected item when
			shuffling resulting in a an assessmentSection containing four items.</p>

	<auxfile name="RTEST-13" title="Steve's Test" url="examples/tests/rtest13.xml">
		<p>This example shows the support for branching based on the response to an assessmentItem.</p>
		<p> The <element_ref name="preCondition"/> element set the conditions that needs to be met
			for an assessmentItem or assessmentSection to be displayed. In nonlinear mode,
			pre-conditions are ignored. </p>
		<p>The <element_ref name="branchCondition"/> element contains a set of rules, evaluated
			during the test, for setting an alternative target as the next item or section. As with
			preconditions, branch rules are ignored in nonlinear mode. The second <element_ref
				name="branchCondition"/> element contains a special targetItem "exitSection" which
			means exit this section of the test</p>

		<p>This example shows how basic statistics of a test are assinged to outcomes.</p>
		<p>A number of build in statistics (<element_ref name="numberCorrect"/>, <element_ref
				name="numberIncorrect/"/>, <element_ref name="numberPresented"/>, <element_ref
				name="numberSelected"/>, <element_ref name="numberResponded/"/>) are assigned to
			Outcome Variables. </p>
		<p>In addition to that the Outcome Variable "PERCENT_CORRECT" is calculated based on two of
